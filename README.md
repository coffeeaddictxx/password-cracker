# password_cracker
Continuing to learn Python through JetBrains courses; this is another project following a series of tutorials.

This script does several things:
- sends logins one by one to the remote server until it gets "Wrong password!" response;
- sends letters and numbers one by one as password until it gets the server to take longer time to response;
- continues all this until it gets the "Connection success!" response.
